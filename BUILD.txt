The project uses pipenv to manage dependancies, so you will need to install it.
There should be a good tutorial on how to restore dependencies on https://github.com/kennethreitz/pipenv

Pipenv Install/Usage instructions:
1. from a fresh command line, run "pip install --user pipenv"
2. add the user python script folder to the path. This should be  .../AppData/Roaming/Python36/Scripts, or {python install location}/Scripts if you didn't use the --user argument.
3. restart the shell and navigate to the project folder
4. run "pipenv install". This will install the dependencies for the project.
5. run "pipenv shell". This activates the virtual environment.
NOTE: There is currently a bug that causes this to launch a command prompt instead of powershell. To fix this, once you run step 5, also run "powershell ."
6. run ./launch.ps1. This will launch flask.
